## [Redesign Collection Page | Analytics] view_item/select item - highlights

Link to ticket: https://rituals.atlassian.net/browse/DL-36446


## Problems I faced in this ticket

- Some smaller issues in triggering the analytics event when DOM element was in view. 
Used the ```useInView``` hook we had, but for some reason the ```rootMargin``` prop doesn't always work. 

## My solution

1. Created the new ```gtmEvent``` called ```pushCollectionPageHighlight``` with the object we need to send
2. Used it in the ```ProductHighlight``` either on click, or on when the element is in view.
3. Wrote a unit test
