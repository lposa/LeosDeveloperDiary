## Problems I faced in this ticket 

- None.

## My solution

1. Added a new constant for the new **FULLY_CANCELLED** response
2. Added it to the same place we are using the **ORDER_CANCELLED** response, combining it with an or statement
3. Made sure we are consuming the correct CF banner tittle
4. Wrote a test plan
