## [BUG] [Redesign Homepage] Category Carousel Navigation Issues

## Problems I faced: 

- None really. Had help from Zeljana. We had to come up with a way do differentiate if hash is coming in manually (if user types it in the url), or if it gets added by changing the carousel slide.

## How I fixed the issues:

1. Added a check in the `useEffect` if hash is not equal to the hash we are adding through the slide click
```javascript
if (
hash &&
hash.split('#')[1] !== gallerySwiperInstance?.slides[gallerySwiperInstance?.activeIndex]?.textContent
) {
```
2.  Also added a quick fix to `slidesInView`, if no banners are here, it takes the value of 0, so nothing crashes.
3. Quick styling fix for `cursor:pointer`, we don't need it on mobile.
