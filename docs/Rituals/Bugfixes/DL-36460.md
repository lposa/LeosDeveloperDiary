## [UX feedback | React] Navigation/header updates


## Problems I faced in this ticket

- None.

## My solution

1. Changed the paddings where asked in ticket (Breadcrumbs.styles.ts; NavigationItem.styles.ts)
2. To achieve the hover effect going the same width as the text inside of it - I have added a span element to wrap the text. Moved the hover effect to target the span instead of the NavItem.
3. Changed colors of USP cta's inside UspBanner.styles.ts
