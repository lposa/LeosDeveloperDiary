## Problems I faced

### How to change theme on page designer

1. Go to Sandbox, Select Rituals Headless
2. Merchant tools -> page designer
3. Find page you need
4. Change theme to component (in this case customer service)


### Page Designer not updating theme

1. Search for aliases in BM
2. Cut them, but SAVE them somewhere
3. Change the theme in PD
4. Go back to aliases and paste them back
