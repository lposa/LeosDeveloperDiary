# DL-36717

## [BUG] UX feedback - Navigation React and SFCC

- Link: https://rituals.atlassian.net/browse/DL-36717

## Problems I faced: 

Biggest issue was the SFCC part, mostly on the .svg icons. We need to remove ```clippath``` and the reference to is in order to load the svg correctly.

Other than that, all good.
