# CSS Frameworks

## Bootstrap vs. Tailwind

### Bootstrap

- Bootstrap is a UI component library, i.e. the end product is a pre-styled button following Bootstrap's design system.


### Tailwind
- Tailwind is a CSS utility library, i.e. the end product is a set of schematically defined CSS classes for you to build your own button schematically.
- Tailwind decreases readability though. We can create our own components, but this isn't really helpful in plain HTML, but rather in React, Vue.js, Angular...
- Tailwind also has a learning curve.
