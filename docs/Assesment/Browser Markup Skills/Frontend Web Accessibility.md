# Frontend Web Accessibility

- We need our html to be semantically correct. This means using the correct html tags, such as `<nav>` , `<footer> `, etc...
- Use the correct attributes such as `aria-expanded=‘false’`, `aria-controls=‘sect1’`, `role=‘region’`, `aria-labeledby=‘’btn1`
- Also, we need to use JavaScript to update some of these attributes, such as `aria-expanded=‘false’`, when for example opening a accordion.
- Hitting TAB to have focus on different elements - FOCUS RINGS
